# What's What
This is a standard load-out of my configs and setups.

## *.source Files
`*.source` files live in the root directory and should be sourced by .bash_profile
(See the `source_this` file for a simple helper.)

## !*.source Files
Other files in the root directory (like `vimrc`) are meant to be symlinked to a common sense location

## install/
Stuff in the install directory will do some initial system configuration.
